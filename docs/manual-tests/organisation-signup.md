## Test 4: Organisation Signup with Immediate Session (Rare Case)

**Objective**: Verify organisation signup handles immediate session creation without email confirmation

**Note**: This flow is rare and depends on Supabase configuration. Email confirmation is typically required.

**Steps** (if email confirmation disabled in Supabase):
1. Navigate to `/signup`
2. Click "Organisation" tab
3. Fill in organisation signup form with unique email (e.g., `testorg+immediate@example.com`)
4. Complete all required fields (organisation name, country, what we do)
5. Click "Create account"
6. **If immediate session granted** (no email confirmation required):
   - Verify immediate redirect to organisation page
   - Verify user logged in automatically
   - Verify organisation created
7. Navigate to organisation page
8. Verify all entered data displayed correctly

**Expected Result** (if applicable):
- ✓ Account created immediately
- ✓ No email confirmation step
- ✓ User logged in automatically
- ✓ Organisation created with pending status
- ✓ User is organisation owner

**Alternative**: If email confirmation always required (expected):
- ✓ Email confirmation flow triggers (same as Test 3)
- ✓ Immediate session NOT granted
- ✓ User must verify email first

**Database Validation**:
```sql
-- Check if email_confirmed_at is set immediately
SELECT email, email_confirmed_at FROM auth.users
WHERE email = 'testorg+immediate@example.com';
-- If immediate: email_confirmed_at should be set
-- If confirmation required: email_confirmed_at should be null until confirmed
```

## Test 5: Pending Organisation Visibility to Creator

**Objective**: Verify organisation creator can see their pending organisation but public cannot

**Prerequisites**: Pending organisation created from Test 3 or Test 4

**Steps**:

### Part A: Logged in as Creator
1. Log in as the user who created the pending organisation
2. Navigate to `/organisations`
3. Check if "Test Pending Org" appears in:
   - Globe view markers
   - Table view listings
   - Search results
4. Navigate directly to organisation page: `/organisations/[slug]` or `/organisations/[id]`
5. Verify organisation page displays:
   - Organisation name
   - All entered information
   - Badge/indicator showing "Pending verification" status
6. Verify creator can:
   - View organisation details
   - Edit organisation (if permissions allow)
   - See "Pending" or "Awaiting verification" status

### Part B: Logged out (Public View)
1. Log out of the application
2. Navigate to `/organisations`
3. Verify "Test Pending Org" does NOT appear in:
   - Globe view
   - Table view
   - Search results
   - Organisation directory
4. Attempt to navigate directly to organisation URL: `/organisations/[slug]`
5. Verify access denied or 404 error (organisation not visible)

### Part C: Logged in as Different User
1. Log in as a different user (not creator, not admin)
2. Navigate to `/organisations`
3. Verify "Test Pending Org" does NOT appear in listings
4. Attempt direct navigation to organisation page
5. Verify access denied (only creator and admins can view)

**Expected Result**:
- ✓ Creator can view their pending organisation
- ✓ Creator sees verification status indicator
- ✓ Public cannot see pending organisation
- ✓ Other logged-in users cannot see pending organisation
- ✓ RLS policies enforce visibility rules

**Database/RLS Validation**:
```sql
-- As creator (using their auth.uid())
-- Should return the pending organisation
SELECT id, name, verification_status FROM organisations
WHERE created_by = auth.uid() AND verification_status = 'pending';

-- As public (logged out) or other user
-- Should return empty result
SELECT id, name FROM organisations
WHERE verification_status = 'pending';
-- Expected: Empty (RLS blocks pending orgs except to creator/admin)

-- Verify verified_organisations view excludes pending
SELECT id, name FROM verified_organisations
WHERE name = 'Test Pending Org';
-- Expected: Empty (only verified orgs in this view)
```

4. Verify all displayed organisations have "Verified" status
5. Verify no pending or rejected organisations appear
6. Test search functionality:
   - Search for pending organisation name
   - Verify it does NOT appear in results
7. Test filters:
   - Apply country filter
   - Apply thematic area filter
   - Verify only verified organisations appear

### Part B: Verified Organisations View
1. Verify dropdown in individual signup uses `verified_organisations` view
2. Navigate to `/signup` → Individual tab
3. Check "Organisation" dropdown
4. Verify only verified organisations appear in dropdown
5. Verify pending organisation does NOT appear in dropdown

### Part C: Direct Access Attempt
1. While logged out, attempt to access pending organisation directly
2. Navigate to `/organisations/[pending-org-slug]`
3. Verify access denied or 404 response
4. Check browser console for errors
5. Verify no data leakage about pending organisation

**Expected Result**:
- ✓ Only verified organisations appear in public directory
- ✓ Pending organisations hidden from public
- ✓ Rejected organisations hidden from public
- ✓ Search and filters respect verification status
- ✓ Direct access to pending orgs blocked for public
- ✓ No data leakage about pending/rejected orgs

**Database/RLS Validation**:
```sql
-- Verify verified_organisations view shows only verified
SELECT id, name, verification_status FROM verified_organisations;
-- Expected: All rows have verification_status = 'verified'

-- Verify organisations_directory_v1 view respects RLS
SELECT id, name FROM organisations_directory_v1;
-- Expected: Only verified organisations returned when accessed by public

-- Verify pending organisations exist but are hidden
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM organisations WHERE verification_status = 'pending';
-- Expected: Count > 0 (pending orgs exist)

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM verified_organisations;
-- Expected: Count < total organisations (pending/rejected excluded)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Email confirmation not received**:
- Check spam/junk folder
- Verify RESEND_API_KEY and RESEND_FROM_EMAIL environment variables configured
- Check Supabase email settings
- Verify email service (Resend) is operational
- Check application logs for email sending errors

**Organisation not appearing in directory**:
- Verify verification_status is 'verified' (not 'pending' or 'rejected')
- Check RLS policies on organisations table
- Verify organisations_directory_v1 view includes the organisation
- Clear browser cache and reload

**Pending organisation visible to public**:
- **SECURITY ISSUE**: Check RLS policies immediately
- Verify `verified_organisations` view filters correctly
- Test query: `SELECT * FROM organisations WHERE verification_status != 'verified'` should be empty for public users

**Cannot create organisation**:
- Verify user is authenticated
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify all required fields filled (name, country_based, what_we_do)
- Check Supabase connection and RLS policies

**LocalStorage pending data not found after email confirmation**:
- Verify localStorage not cleared between signup and confirmation
- Check browser privacy settings (localStorage may be blocked)
- Verify redirection to `/onboarding/organisation` occurs
- Check if user opened confirmation link in different browser/device

**RLS tests failing**:
- Verify Supabase RLS policies enabled on all tables
- Check is_admin() function returns correct value for admin users
- Verify auth.uid() returns correct user ID
- Test policies in Supabase SQL editor with SET statements to simulate different users

## Security Reminders

🔒 **Critical**: Pending and rejected organisations MUST NOT be visible to public or non-creator users. Any failure of this test is a **security vulnerability** and must be fixed immediately before deployment.

🔒 **Critical**: Users must NOT be able to modify verification_status of their own organisations. Only admins with is_admin()=true should have this permission.

🔒 **Critical**: RLS policies must be enabled on all tables. Test thoroughly before deployment to production.
